All that said, we were of 2 minds when he said to my surprise that he favoured the savoury variety of breads. While I like both varieties, I was thrilled w/this bread & felt it was the best loaf of bread I'd ever made. The aroma of the cinnamon & nutmeg while baking & the taste of the buttered bread warm from the ABM were beyond divine! I did have a prob w/its texture. The bread is so light & airy that I couldn't get a uniform slice for toast. The bread fell apart in cloud-like pieces that I scooped up & devoured.

We don't have colds at the moment - touch wood - but with winter approaching this seemed like a good recipe to try! I made breezermom's delicious Recipe #328649 yesterday to use it in this soup, so that has to have contributed to how yummy this soup was. I opted for butter as I prefer it in cooking and made this pretty much to the recipe, though I did add some garlic, sliced mushrooms and dried thyme (sorry, just couldn't resist adding those: the mushrooms were in the fridge and kind of begging to be included).

Having read prior reviews, I began w/3 extra tbsp water, did not use the opt raisins & added 1 tsp nutmeg as I favor it combined w/cinnamon. My ABM made very painful sounds as it tried to mix & knead, so I added a 4th tbsp of water & then a 5th b4 I felt the dough was starting to mix better. It still did not seem well-mixed when done, so I took it out of the ABM,  kneaded it on my counter & left it to rise ~ but it did not seem to rise easily, so I encouraged it in a 100F oven for a cpl of min & that worked well. I let it rest to finish rising, oven-baked the bread & all was well.

I had a collection of veggies I wanted to use up, so for the salad we had iceberg lettuce, matchstick carrots, purple cabbage, chives & green onions.

Second time, I reduced the cinnamon to 1/2 teaspoon because my kids dont like cinnamon with  meat, it tasted too strong. As in other Mediterranean recipes, I substituted the cinnamon with Arab Levant ``baharat´´ spices, the mixture of which can be made from any internet recipe for baharat on the with cheap spices in your kitchen (or you can use any Mediterranean 7-spice combination as recommended by a Turkish store owner).  Then I added more water and simmered on very low heat till beef fell apart when pierced by a fork. Wonderful, exotic taste.  More water also diluted the spices a bit for those who are not particularly fond of exotic Arab food due to the strong Arab spices of cinnamon and nutmeg and people had a hard time deciphering which spices I used. Top with fresh herbs for a wonderful aroma. Thanks Sue L for this wonderful recipe :) \n",

After running the dough through the machine into sheets, we made linguine out of it.  I allowed it to dry on plastic wrap for a couple hours and then placed it well covered in the refrigerator.  Had it the next day for dinner with meatballs and it was fabulous.  It took about 5 minutes to get al dente.  I highly recommend this recipe for anyone who would like to try making homemade pasta.

However, this is a very cool recipe and I'm jealous it isn't mine. You could have so much fun with this ex: Individual Ramekins with a spoonful of salsa on the bottom, then the egg, then topping of your choice. I did not have a frying pan (I don't think so anyhow) that had an oven safe handle to 400*, so I used a flat bottomed 1 1/2 quart pyrex casserole dish, and baked for 20 minutes.

That said, these were really very easy and the kids absolutely loved them. Next time I think I'll let rise on a heavily floured tea towel and see how that goes.

That's not a fault of the recipe, just something I'll work on next time. The glaze was very good, and I love the idea of stirring in some raspberry jam or melted chocolate chips for variations.

I am accustomed to making pie fillings and puddings in the microwave- have been doing this for years.  (The only way to do it, IMO.)  I was skeptical about the recipe not including eggs, but with as many great reviews that it recieved, I thought it would be okay to try it.  BUT, I see now what the addition of eggs does for a pudding.  That smoothy, creamy texture and rich flavor was totally lacking in this recipe.  It pretty much tasted like chocolatey cornstarch \"glop\".  Today, after sitting in the fridge overnight, the texture is almost like gelatin!  Bleh.  I am very disappointed in this recipe and next time I need a chocolate fix, will RUN back to my old recipe.

It is very hard to resist them and thus they disappear fast! :)<br/>I made half the recipe using a mixture of cashew nuts, almonds, hazelnuts and walnuts in place of just walnuts. I pressed the mixture into a silicone candy pan and got 12 mini candies, tiny bite-sized pieces of yummyness. :)<br/>Next time I might try reducing the jam a tad as I found the raspberry flavour a tad too strong, but other than that these are perfect and Ill make them again for sure!<br/>THANK YOU SO MUCH for sharing such an easy and delicious recipe with us, NorthwestGal!<br/>Made and reviewed for one of my babies during PAC Spring 2012.\n",

I'm not a fan of beets, and everyone I talked to today looked at me funny when I explained what I was making for dinner!  But hubby has really good taste in food so I can't imagine not liking something he enjoys!  I used a brisket for the beef and used about a carton of low sodium beef stock instead of all water.  I also added a potato and put in whole garlic cloves with the other veggies instead of waiting until the end.  Mainly because I am lazy. :)  I think I ended up cooking it about an hour longer than this recipe calls for because I wanted the meat to break up easily.

Awe the life with an illness.  :(  But now, on to the review.  We truly enjoyed this take on spaghetti sauce.  It really elevated the bottled Ragu Traditional that I used to a whole new level.  I made ours vegetarian, simply because I hadn&#039;t thawed out any ground beef and it turned out very well.  I was a little hesitant to add in the celery, as I don&#039;t like it, but I pushed past that and stuck to your recipe, only I grated the celery so there wouldn&#039;t be any large pieces, and I&#039;m glad I didn&#039;t leave it out.  It was a distinct flavor, but enough to add a little extra flavor.  I served this over spaghetti noodles with Texas toast on the side for a wonderful Father&#039;s Day dinner.

My dad likes his granola just barely sweet so I added the 3 cups of oats then about 1 cup of wheat germ, bran, spelt flakes, wheat flakes, and various other flakes.  I also omitted the coconut for his prefernce.  Instead of vegetable oil I used 1 1/2 tbsp peanut oil which gave a greater peanut flavour.  I loved the idea of whole peanuts in a granola!!  I love peanuts.  My granola didn't clump up all that much but that was probably because of more flakes therefore less molasses mixture to go around.  It still made one delicious crunchy granola.

We use 3 eggs, a cup of milk, a good teaspoon of salt and flour til you have a sticky blob. 4-6 cups (the spoon should pretty much stand up in the batter) We also remove the meat and sauerkraut from the pot and then bring the water back to a rolling boil. Then dip a tablespoon into the water to wet the spoon, then pick up a good tablespoon of batter and drop into boiling water. Fill the bottom of the pot with dumplings, but don't crowd. Once you have a batch in, do a quick stir once around the pot to make sure they aren't stuck to the bottom and then put the lid on and let them boil for 5 minutes. NO PEAKING. Remove from water when done, serve. We also make homemade croutons by cutting up fresh bread into cubes and frying in butter. Because we make such a big production of this meal, we start with about 6 slices of bread and a stick of butter.

A smooth creamy Guac where no one taste becomes overpowering, I have made this a little stiffer by adding additional avocados for spreading on thin toasted bread as an appetizer and (fractionally) more liquid by adding more cream cheese for use as a dip with chips, and even the same as a thick dressing for over a lettuce/cuccumber/tomato salad for something a little different to the usual olive oils etc when we are having salads almost every single day thoughout the summer. I naturally used Dutch sambal as the hot pepper ingredient, a very little goes a long way but gives just enough zing to make this Guac recipe very popular indeed. I've been trying to get away from packet mixes that are available to add to avocados to make Guacamole, this recipe enabled me to decide to achieve that & will get regular use at our table from now on.

I made several mistakes in making this recipe and it still turned out very good. Instead of cooking the onions first, I accidently added them to the ground beef. Accidently used regular mustard instead of dried.And then I added the beans along with the sauce ingredients. And despite all the mess ups, the dish turned out just fine. The taste is something that makes you think of summertime picnics and cookouts.This will be made again, but next time the right way. Thanks for posting and, \"Keep Smiling :)\"\n",

            "05/03/08 - We used regular cream cheese as they were out of neufchatel at the grocery store. We also used graham crackers in lieu of gingersnap crumbs. We chose the whipping of the 2 egg whites but next time we will use the whole egg version. The pineapple topping is absolutely wonderful! It has an outstanding flavor and we can see using it for a pineapple ice cream sundae easliy and have since used it for Recipe #170308. The cheese cake was okay, but a bit too fluffy. We could not taste the coconut (extract) and at the time of this review and the toasted coconut was not included in the original recipe. Four people gave a combined average rating of 3.5 stars. -------- 05/07/08 Made again with revisions using a 5\" mini springform pan reducing the ingredients to 2 servings. I used graham crackers for the crust, but added about 1/8 tsp of ground ginger to get as close to the list ingredients as possible and it worked out wonderfully. I also had to use regular cream cheese (I think neufchatel is on strike around here). I lightly toasted (deseccated) the coconut for color and presentation. The added coconut topping does add a bit of sweetness, but goes extremely well with the pineapple. We suggest using a thin layer of pineapple topping to compensate. Not whipping the egg whites makes this cheesecake nicely dense and flavorful. The presentation is as wonderful as the taste. Thank you Sharon, for tweeking this recipe and giving it a second go round. :)\n",

I also had to cook it in my slow cooker as I didn't have a pot big enough to hold all the ingredients!! I fried up the beef and then let everything besides the pasta cook in the slow cooker for about 3 to 4 hours on low. I boiled the pasta up as directed on the box and added it pretty much right before serving.

Bf and I both thought this was just OK.  The color on this dish was really pretty though.  I used the full sauce recipe and the full amts for the coating mixture, and the rest just whatever I had on hand.  It made a large helping for 2 people and the sauce was just right to keep everything moist and give flavor to the white rice I served it with.

I was looking and looking for a \"good\" moist and sweet cornbread recipe and had the hardest time finding it and ultimately thought I couldn't because I was not looking for a vegan recipe.  3 years ago I needed to make a vegan cornbread for our vegan friends and I came across this recipe.  I have made this over and over and over again- no one can tell it is vegan-- so, it is the cornbread I make for my entire family and all friends whether vegan or not!<br/><br/>You can use cow's milk- when I did I used 2% or Fat free.  But honestly it tastes better with the Soy. I have added frozen corn and even pickled jalapenos and it always turns out great!  I may try reducing the syrup in the future to give it a less sweet and more savory taste- but that may upset all who I make this for :) <br/><br/>I just bought new double ovens and found that 35 minutes is a bit too long in the oven and I actually cooked them last night at 350 for 25 minutes (conventional not convection).  They were very moist and of course very sweet and make a great breakfast the next day!<br/><br/>The reason I post this review now (3 years later) is because last night I lost the printed recipe and went to look for it again online and came across it twice on Food.com (I thought this was funny).  It just has a different name, Moist Vegan Cornbread.  It is the EXACT same recipe and does not give credit to Candace & Amy at the Vegan Lunch Box (which I appreciate this one did).  I also noticed that it has more reviews.  Of course they are mostly all 5 star because this recipe is AWESOME!

I posted the picture up (hopefully, it gets approved): one loaf, I braided it like challah bread and the other, I mocked a cinnamon roll, then braided it.  For the cinnamon roll version, I flattened the dough, poured melted butter and slabbed on a generous mixture of cinnamon and brown sugar.  Then I rolled it like a cinnamon roll to make it into one large loaf.  I then took scissors and made three even cuts, be sure not to cut it all the way, leave the top part to 'tuck' under.

The topping was piled high when I placed them in the oven on a foil covered baking sheet (to make clean up easy). Baking them softened the apples, and melted the topping down so it ended up almost level with the top of the ramekins when they were done. They turned out perfect.

I doubled the meat and added a second egg because of this. ALSO, instead salt I used Mrs. Dash all seasoning without salt which has oregano in it. The albondigas felt like they stayed together pretty well, but i still browned them on a skillet to be safe and get some of the fat out.<br/>2. For the soup I used Knorr Swissa chicken and tomato flavored boullion to make the stock. I added Hunt's tomato sauce flavored with basil, oregano and something else.  I also used two whole jalapenos with the stem cut off to give the soup some spice at the beginning.  I added chopped carrots with the meatballs and instead of zuchinni i used fingerling baby potatoes for the last ten minutes<br/><br/>It came out delicious and i am eatting it with cornbread to fight off my flu\n",

I thought I made this wrong at first as the batter was very sticky and I had a hard time mixing the ingredients.  It also didn't spread in pan very well, but as it was baking... it evened out.  It actually reminds me more of a bread pudding than cake, but still very good!  The only thing I did different was combine the cut rhubarb with a 1/4 cup sugar and let that sit for about 30 mins before folding into batter to cut the tartness and also subbed cinnamon for nutmeg.

            "They say necessity is the mother of invention. I was craving a New York style crumb cake and Tracy K recommended this one to me. To my dismay I discovered I only had olive oil and no milk and did not feel like going shopping. The olive oil would have been too strong a flavored substitue for the canola oil. That forced me to make a few minor changes that worked out just fine. Instead of using canola oil and flour to grease the baking pan, I used butter and flour. The recipe called for 1/2 cup of milk and 2 tablespoons of canola oil. I didn't have milk in the house but did have a quart of heavy cream. I used heavy cream in place of the milk and increased the amount from 1/2 to 2/3 as cream is much thicker than milk. I didn't add any oil as the heavy cream's higher fat content took it's place too. The rest of the recipe I followed as written. As a few other reviewers found the batter is a bit thick and not easily spread. Instead of adding anymore liquid as one reviewr had, I lightly sprinkled a bit of flour over the batter in the pan and dusted my hands with the flour as well. This allowed me to easily pat the batter perfectly into place withought it sticking to my hands or changing the battter itself. Almost everyone mentioned needing extra baking time, and I was no exception. It took me a total of 30 minutes rather than the 20 the recipe called for before it was done. The end result was fabulous. The texture of the cake was wonderful and the crumbs were perfect too. I will definitely make this one again :) While over-all I found the cake excellent, the cake part was a bit different than what I buy here locally. I think it should have been more like a pound cake or gold cake consistency. It didn't rise as high and light as the cake part of what I buy. Sort of like expecting a cake and ending up with a something more the consistency of a brownie. I gave it 5 stars anyway as it was good on it's own merit. If I were rating it soley on wehther it was a duplicate of what I buy I would have given it only 4.\n",

As written it says 3 tbsp or 2 pkgs of yeast. 3 tbsp is 9 tsp and I thought that was perhaps a typo so I added 4 1/2 tsp from a jar and that seemed to work well.

I had Grands biscuits on hand and was afraid they would be too large, since they are twice as big as called for (recipe calls for 10 1-ounce biscuits and a tube of Grands is 8 2-ounce biscuits). This size was perfect, though, and after making these I really think the smaller biscuits would be too small. I also had an 11-ounce can of Mexicorn, rather than 7-ounce, so I only used part of it; it ended up that there would have been plenty of room for the rest of the can. Anyway, next time I would definitely use the Grands again and would also use the full 11 ounces of corn.

            "We enjoyed this chicken Di! I used Kraft's Brown Sugar BBQ sauce, which we find comparable to Bull's Eye. It too has a liquid smoke flavouring,so hubby and I pretty much agreed that the BBQ sauce pretty much overpowered the other spices & the bacon,(although the bacon was good for texture.) So, I might be tempted to just skip those ingredients next time. However, it may be worth a try with a very mild(or less?) BBQ sauce. You could probably even make this dish without the BBQ sauce and still have something very tasty. Hubby thought that mushrooms would be good under the cheese, probably because it would then be similar to something he does, sometimes when we are just having plain BBQ chicken breasts, he will put mushrooms & onions on top and melt cheese over it for a little change.  The green onions & tomatoes on top dressed this up nicely. We had this with Mashed red potatoes with garlic & parmesan by Mizz Nezz and green & yellow beans with baby carrots and we enjoyed a very nice meal in both taste & presentation!

Also, I pre-baked the crust before I added my toppings but before doing so i placed string cheese around the edge of the crust and folded some of the dough over it while firmly pinching the crease.  Then i used the prongs of a fork to score the seal and to further insure that it would not come undone while baking I brushed the seal with egg yolk.  MMMMM talk about tasty cheese stuffed crust!!!

Instantly became my \"go-to\" bread recipe. Used the 1.5 size and a medium crust color and it was delish!<br/>2 - again using regular all-purpose unbleached flour, I replaced the shortening with butter - no change in taste that I could discern, but the crust was softer and less crusty.<br/>3 - My personal favorite - I returned to using the shortening instead of butter but I used bread flour (Kroger brand) instead and the taste and texture were significantly improved in my honest opinion - THIS version is now my \"go-to\" bread recipe - absolutely the best homemade bread I've ever made or had. My daughter cannot get enough of it - she asks for it constantly!<br/>Oh, and in 2 & 3 I did reduce the cook time to the light setting for the crust.

            "This pie was discussed in a Zaar thread and it was certainly one of the stranger concepts for a pie that I ever encountered, so naturally, I had to try it! Lucky for me, when I went to Whole Foods to find some cheese worthy of this recipe, an employee who grew up in Florida, exclaimed, \"Oh my God! I grew up with Tomato Pies and THIS is the cheese we all use down there!\" So, I bought a Parrano Uniekaas Dutch Cheese and a Black Diamond Cheddar which was aged 5 years, plus the Parmesan. By the photos that I included, you can tell that I chose to use a wide variety of Heirloom tomatoes, just for fun.  The recipe went together like a snap, (I put Panko crumbs on top with the Parmesan), and the smell was amazing, as it baked. It's a tad runny, but when we sat down to try this new recipe, we were bowled over by the taste!!! Even my very, very picky daugher who only likes pizza, asked for a second slice. :) I would plan on serving this at least a couple of times per year, just for the heck of it but I could easily see this being stunning at a brunch, too! So glad that I stumbled upon the \"Tommy Toe Pie\" thread and had the time and courage to make this most unusual addition to our dinner menu.\n",

The entire pan was gone within 2 hours, and that wasn't even for a party or anything, just people wandering through our office area. I did have a little trouble with the crust part (of my own doing). The mixture seemed a bit too dry and crumbly to stick together when I used the original 1/2 cup butter, so I added a couple more tbs. of butter. Apparently, I added enough butter for the crust to start trying to become a cake when baked. I should have used a deeper pan after that, because the crust bubbled up, went overboard onto the oven floor, and created a crusty mess. My fault, no big deal though. They were nice and rich, no one knew that the crust was a cake mix because it was so fudgy and brownie-like,and they were pretty simple to make. I'll be making these again (in a deeper pan, of course)! Thanks for posting! Oh, and I omitted the nuts due to nut allergies at the office, and used those new caramel swirl chips in place of the butterscotch. I'll use butterscotch next time, since I recently found some Guittard butterscotch chips on sale (much better tasting than the Nestle's, IMO). Thanks again!  :)\n",

All I had was a can of Sloppy Joe Sauce. Close enough...So I omitted the green pepper and salt as there's enough in the SJ Sauce and added lots of onion, (I love onion), and added about 1/2 cup of water to the can of SJ Sauce. I was very disappointed because there were NO LEFTOVERS! BTW there were only two of us eating! I will definately try it the original way next time, (and there will be many next times :)) I would even leave it the way I made it, less cans to open and still delish! Thanks for a keeper.\n",

            "Yup, this is definetly the easiest way I ever found to get a crispy baked potatoe. I learned this by accident in my very early married years when money was even more tight than it is now. Ran out of foil and wanted to make baked potatoes, so I gave this a try. Stabbed them as usual to release steam. I think the only thing I did different the first time, was to lightly oil the skin but I have baked them without greasing the skin since then too. If I remember, I thought the grease on the skin might add flavor. Foil covering is only used now if I have company, so they will stay warm a little longer and so everyone can grab their own easily. It's amazing the \"secrets\" you can discover when you are forced to improvise. But then lets face it, what did people do to roast/bake potatoes before aluminum foil? :)\n",

            "This soup was a pleasure to make just because it is so colorful.  The fact that it has wonderful flavor does not hurt it this reviewer one bit either.    Here are a few notes on the way I fixed my roux since megnbrycesmom had some trouble with hers.  I put the onions in a small saucepan because I wanted them to sweat as they sauteed.  I then added the flour and starch and yes it did get very pasty.  But I continued to cook the roux for 2 minutes.  Mind you that was not the easiest thing to do but it can be done.  I proceeded to add 2 cups of milk into the pan and whisked the best I could since it was a small saucepan.  I then strained that into the soup pot with a Tupperware plastic strainer since it had large holds.  (Do not use a fine strainer.)  Added the onions and what lumps were left back into the saucepan along with the last 2 cups of milk and just went on whisking out those lumps.  This worked great!   Added the cheese and now I'm enjoying a very nice bowl of broccoli soup with no floury after taste.  Thanks Grammy :-) I hope this review will be helpful to those who might not be use to making a thick roux.    Made for *1 2 3 Hit Wonders* game 2007\n",

First off I will let you know that I used the water in the recipe as I do not have Sherry or a suitable wine in the house. Don&#039;t think it would make that much of a taste difference. Also, I had a bag of mini sweet peppers that I needed to use up so I used them in place of the green bell peppers (look like small jalape&ntilde;o peppers but taste like red, yellow and orange bells). The last adjustment I made was to use cashews in place of the walnuts do to an allergy. The dish was simple to prepare and very flavorful. I served it alongside some steamed broccoli and snow pea pods. Really wanted rice to go with it but forgot to add it to the shopping list. Will definitely be making this again soon.

I found them to be VERY chewy (kind of hard for the kids to manage), but again, the flavor is good when you want something REALLY sweet. I found it helpful to allow the cookies to rest for a minute after removing them from the oven before transferring them to the rack. I made an extra batch of the dough for my daughter's preschool class. They are doing a cooking activity (making sugar cookies), and my daughter is allergic to milk and eggs. This recipe will be great for them. It's very easy for little hands to handle, and it's fun to roll them up and roll them in the sugar. I will use colored sugar next time.

I made sure the flour was very dissolved in the evap milk before adding it.  It also needed major seasoning.  I added garlic, salt, pepper and thyme.  This recipe definitley has 5* potential, but I think it should be a stovetop recipe (either that or don't add the dairy products/cheese to the Crockpot until the very end).

If you&#039;ve never had fresh blue cheese dressing it&#039;s light years better than the stuff in a bottle. On chilled iceberg lettuce wedges with fresh summer tomatoes, this was to die for. Would suggest stirring together about an hour before serving, and keeping chilled during that time. After reading the reviews, would also suggest making only the amount you could use in a day or two. Homemade blue cheese dressing does not have the preservatives in commercial varieties. It does not store well and goes off very quickly. That said, I&#039;m pretty sure one of my sons was eating spoonfuls of the dressing, so storage may not be much of an issue:) Thanks for sharing the recipe!\n",
